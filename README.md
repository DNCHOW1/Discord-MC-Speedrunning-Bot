# Discord-MC-Speedrunning-Bot
Bot that supports Minecraft Speedrunning Leaderboard. Keeps track of speedrunning times and allows times to be added or removed.

The amount of participants make me sad.

TODO: 
* Method to keep track of leaders and update positions is jank, needs to be redone
* Need to populate speedrun text file with bloated entries to test leaderboard functionality.
